However in practice you will likely be installing Node Exporter on another VPS or other remote machine. The process is largely similar to installing it locally with a few extra steps.
These directions go through the process I use for installing Node Exporter on remote virtual private servers running Ubuntu 20.04. To begin we&amp;rsquo;ll assume you have access to a remote machine/VPS through SSH or other &amp;lsquo;terminal&amp;rsquo; access with &amp;lsquo;sudo&amp;rsquo; permissions.</description></item><item><title>Installing Prometheus</title><link>https://resettech.net/posts/monitoring/prom_install/</link><pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://resettech.net/posts/monitoring/prom_install/</guid><description>Prometheus is an open-source application created for systems monitoring and alerting. The Prometheus server application can produce limited visualizations of data that it collects and stores from Exporters which send it the data. Prometheus and it&amp;rsquo;s Exporters are good for measuring numerical values over time, things such as: Data Storage/Memory Usage, Network Stats, and Process Monitoring.
Prometheus is often paired with the open-source visualization software Grafana which improves the end-user experience by making queries easier and better looking.</description></item></channel></rss>
